# javaScript_lectures
- Continuation of JavaScript lectures.

## Lecture one-07.11.18

- Created folder structure.
- 'use strict'
 - the use strict directive switches the engine to the modern mode changing the behavior of some built in features.
 - Variables are storage units to store information.
 - A variable is named storage for data.
 - To create a variable in JS we need to use the keyword let or var.
 - assignment operator =
 - after we then we add a 'string'
 - a string in JS is a set of characters that are surrounded by quotation marks
 - Created  sentences using concat.

## Operators:

- + addition
- '-' subtraction
- / division
- * multiplication 

- the + operator can be applied to two strings values. This will join two strings together, otherwise called concatenation.
- in the console we concatinated the following example; 
- 'Hey' + ' there '

## lecture two - 09.11.18
- what is a condition?
- Alternative conditions.
- Nesting conditions.

### Task
- Build a program or write a program that helps students decide what to wear based on the weather using the if statement else and if else   statement.

## All the notes for the second lecture, are written withing the conditions.js, folder as comments.

## Lecture three
- What are loops.

## Functions
- A function is a group of instructions that performs a particular task.
- the keyword return indicates that a return value will be given, which is specified 
  immediately after the word.
- Did a pop quiz in class on javaScript.

## Objects
- Think about objects in the non-programming sense,like a pen. A pen can have different ink colors, be manufactured    by different people, have a different tip and many other properties.
- Similarly , an object in programming is an entity that has properties. Each property defines a characteristic of     the object. A property can be information associated with the object(the color of the open) or action (the pens      ability to write).
- What does this have to do with code?
- Object-oriented programming (OOP for short) is a way to write programs using objects.When using OOP, you write,      create, and modifying objects, and the objects make up your programme.
- OOP changes the way a program is written and organized. So far you've been writing function-based code, sometimes    called the procedural programming. Now lets discover  how to write object- orientated programming0
- JavaScript and objects
- Like many other languages, JS involves programming objects so we can say it is an object-orientated language. it     provides a number of predefined objects while also letting you create your  own.


## objects and prototypes:
- In addition to its special properties, every JS object has an internal property called prototype.This is a link(known as a referance) to another object. when trying to access a property that does not exist in an object js tries to find this property in the prototype of this object.


##Technologies used:
- HTML
- JS
- CSS
